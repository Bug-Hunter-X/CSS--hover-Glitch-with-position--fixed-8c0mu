The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue with unexpected behavior when using `:hover` pseudo-class along with `position: fixed`. The hover effect should only apply when the cursor is directly over the element. However, due to the fixed positioning, the hover state might remain active even when the cursor moves out of the element's boundaries. This is because fixed-positioned elements do not affect the document flow, making it difficult for the browser to accurately determine when the cursor is no longer over the element.  This leads to unexpected visual glitches. 
```css
#myElement {
  position: fixed;
  top: 50px;
  left: 50px;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

#myElement:hover {
  background-color: lightgreen;
}
```
